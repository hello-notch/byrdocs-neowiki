Write all review summaries, findings, suggestions, and comments in Chinese.

## Review Scope

Treat `src/others/guide.mdx` as the source of truth for content rules, and use `src/others/test.mdx` as a concrete example of valid exam MDX usage.

### Exam files (`exams/`)

- Every exam must use the directory layout `exams/<试卷名>/index.mdx`. Related image or audio assets must live as sibling files in that same directory, not under `public/`.
- Directory names must follow the `学年开始-学年结束-学期-科目-阶段（备注）` naming convention.
- Frontmatter must be complete and normalized:
  - `时间`: use `xxxx-yyyy学年第[一/二]学期` format
  - `科目`: official Chinese full course name
  - `阶段`: `期中` or `期末`
  - `类型`: `本科` or `研究生`
  - Optional fields (`学院`, `来源`, `答案完成度`) must follow the guide if present
- Body must use standard Markdown and the repository's supported MDX components (`Blank`, `Slot`, `Choices`, `Option`, `Solution`, `Figure`, `Audio`). No custom JSX, scripts, or inline styles.
- Heading structure: major questions use `##`, subquestions use `###` only when appropriate. Choice/blank/judgment questions should use lists instead of overusing headings.
- `Figure` / `Audio` references must use local file names within the same exam directory.
- **`<Figure float>` placement**: a `<Figure>` with the `float` attribute must live **inside** the section of the question it belongs to — i.e. *after* the question heading (`##` / `###`). It may sit immediately under the heading, between body paragraphs, or after the body; placement immediately under the heading is the recommended default. **Never** place a `<Figure float>` above its question heading: it would be parsed as belonging to the previous section, and on mobile the image gets rendered above the heading, breaking the question structure.

  Wrong (the figure block appears before `## 三、计算题`):

  ```mdx
  <Figure src="第三题图.svg" float>
      第三题图
  </Figure>

  ## 三、计算题
  （5 分）已知线性无源网络 $N_0$……
  ```

  Correct:

  ```mdx
  ## 三、计算题

  <Figure src="第三题图.svg" float>
      第三题图
  </Figure>

  （5 分）已知线性无源网络 $N_0$……
  ```
- Prefer actionable comments tied to rendering or editorial correctness. Avoid low-value wording suggestions unless wording creates ambiguity.
- **Answer correctness**: For questions that contain answers (marked with `+` or `<Option correct>` in `<Choices>`, content inside `<Blank>...</Blank>`, or content inside `<Solution>...</Solution>`), verify the correctness of the provided answers. This applies to all subjects. If an answer is wrong, point out the specific question, explain why it is incorrect, and provide the correct answer. You should ask the contributors to confirm the questions and answers precisely rather than forcing them to correct the answers.
- **Inspect referenced images.** Whenever a question references an image via `<Figure src="...">`, open the image file with your image-viewing tool and check: (a) the figure actually depicts what the surrounding prose describes; (b) any numeric or structural detail the answer depends on (circuit topology, component values, geometric labels, axis orientation, waveform readings, etc.) is consistent with both the question text and the given answer. If the image is handwritten, blurry, or otherwise illegible, say so explicitly ("图片不清晰，无法核对") instead of silently skipping it.

### Site code (`src/`, `astro.config.mts`, config files)

- Review as an Astro + TypeScript project.
- Focus on regressions, broken routes, invalid MDX integration, content rendering issues, or build/check failures.
- Avoid subjective refactoring suggestions.

### General principles

- If a PR only updates exam content, avoid requesting engineering-heavy refactors. Focus on whether the content is renderable, follows the editing guide, and will pass `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check`, and `pnpm build`.
- Before suggesting major structural changes, verify compatibility with the existing editor workflow for non-programmer contributors. Changes that make exam editing harder should be treated as a risk.
- Prefer findings only when the change breaks the guide or likely harms reader experience.

## Review Output Format

**All review feedback must be organized under the three categories below.** Put each finding in exactly one category — do not duplicate. Always render all three category headings in the review summary, even when empty (write `无` under any empty category) so contributors can see the per-category counts at a glance.

### 必须修改 (Must fix — blocks merge)

Clear errors, clear rule violations, and anything that should not merge until resolved. Examples:
- Answers that are clearly wrong, or self-contradictory with the question text
- Typos (wrong / missing / extra characters)
- Misplaced `<Figure float>` (see the Figure placement rule above)
- Frontmatter format errors, missing fields, or values outside the allowed set
- Broken file references (`<Figure src>` / `<Audio src>` pointing to a file that doesn't exist or lives in the wrong directory)
- Question numbering or option numbering inconsistent within the same paper
- Misuse of MDX components that breaks rendering or fails `pnpm check` / `pnpm build`
- Directory names that violate the `学年开始-学年结束-学期-科目-阶段（备注）` convention

### 建议修改 (Suggested — nice to fix, does not block merge)

Typography and consistency issues. Don't block merge on these, but try to land them. Examples:
- Spacing between Chinese and adjacent Latin letters / digits / inline math (see Typography below)
- Mixing full-width and half-width punctuation
- Inconsistent question / numbering style within the same paper (e.g. some `（1）` and some `(1)`, some `①` and some `1.`)
- Proper noun capitalization (`GitHub`, `JavaScript`, `iOS`, ...)s

### 请确认 (Please confirm — you can't verify it yourself)

Knowledge or time-sensitive facts you **cannot reliably check**, but where something looks off. Examples:
- Answers in subjects you are not confident about
- Regulations, standards, version numbers, or textbook page references cited in the question that you cannot verify
- Factual claims in the question prompt (people, events, years, figures) you cannot verify

For this category: state your doubt and ask the contributor to confirm. Do not phrase it as "this is wrong, change it to X."

## Review Decision

- 必须修改 **non-empty** → **REQUEST CHANGES**
- 必须修改 empty, but 建议修改 or 请确认 non-empty → **APPROVE** (keep the suggestions as comments)
- All three categories empty → **APPROVE**, optionally with a brief acknowledgement

## Suggested Changes (one review summary + many inline suggestions)

When you **REQUEST CHANGES** — and even when you **APPROVE** but have 建议修改 entries — **do not** dump every finding into one long top-level comment. Use the GitHub MCP to submit feedback as **one review summary plus many inline review comments**:

1. **Pending review summary**: holds the three-section overview (必须修改 / 建议修改 / 请确认). Each entry is a one-line description pointing at a specific file and line range. The summary is an *index*, not a place for concrete patches.
2. **Inline review comments**: attach a comment on the actual line(s) of each finding. **Whenever a fix can be expressed as a concrete textual replacement** (typo, spacing, punctuation, Figure attribute, frontmatter field value, answer correction, ...), include a GitHub `suggestion` block in that inline comment:

   ````markdown
   <Which category this finding belongs to (必须修改 / 建议修改 / 请确认), plus a short explanation of why this change.>

   ```suggestion
   <The exact replacement line(s) the contributor should commit.>
   ```
   ````

   Contributors can then commit your suggestion with one click — especially valuable for non-programmer contributors.

3. Submit the review with the appropriate event: `REQUEST_CHANGES` when 必须修改 is non-empty, otherwise `COMMENT` or `APPROVE`.

Rules of thumb:
- The `suggestion` block must contain the **complete final line(s)** as they should appear in the file. No diff markers, no `...` ellipses, no abbreviated indentation. A multi-line suggestion must cover all corresponding original lines.
- If a finding cannot be expressed as a single concrete textual replacement (e.g. "请确认这道题的答案", or a request to re-typeset an entire section), write a plain inline comment **without** a `suggestion` block. Don't force one in.
- For 建议修改 (typography polish), still prefer the inline `suggestion` form even when you ultimately APPROVE — it makes one-click adoption frictionless.
- Don't post multiple `suggestion` blocks against the same line. If several edits land on the same line, merge them into a single `suggestion` block within one inline comment.

## Typography (applies to BOTH your review comments AND contributor MDX content)

These are Chinese-typesetting conventions. They are about prose readability, **not** about whether anything renders. Apply them as content polish: flag systematic / repeated violations, but do not chase single infelicities in an otherwise clean document, and do not block a PR over them.

### Spacing

- **Insert a half-width space between Chinese and adjacent Latin letters / digits / inline math (`$...$`).** Inline math is treated as Latin/numeric content for this rule.
  - 正确：`LeanCloud 上`，`5000 元`，`$5\Omega$ 电阻`，`$x$ 的取值范围`，`求 $f(x)$ 的极值`
  - 错误：`LeanCloud上`，`5000元`，`$5\Omega$电阻`，`$x$的取值范围`，`求$f(x)$的极值`
- **No space** between a number and its unit, or between a number and `°` / `%`.
  - 正确：`10TB`，`233°`，`15%`
  - 错误：`10 TB`，`233 °`，`15 %`
- **No space** between full-width punctuation (`，。？！：；“”（）《》` etc.) and adjacent characters. Full-width punctuation overrides the Chinese-Latin spacing rule.
  - 正确：`答案是 $x=1$。`，`iPhone，好开心！`
  - 错误：`答案是 $x=1$ 。`，`iPhone ，好开心 ！`
- Exception: established product names follow the official form (e.g. `豆瓣FM`).

### Punctuation

- Use full-width Chinese punctuation inside Chinese sentences (`，。？！：；“”（）`), not half-width (`, . ? ! "" ()`).
- A complete English sentence or quoted English title nested inside Chinese keeps half-width punctuation internally (e.g. `“Stay hungry, stay foolish.”`).
- Do not repeat punctuation (`！！！`，`？？！！`).

### Numbers and proper nouns

- Use half-width digits (`1000`, not `１０００`).
- Capitalize proper nouns correctly: `GitHub` (not `github` / `Github`), `JavaScript`, `MacBook Pro`, `iOS`.

### Reviewer guidance on typography fixes

- If a PR includes a typography fix like `$5\Omega$电阻 → $5\Omega$ 电阻`, endorse it as **中文排版规范（中英文/中文与公式之间加空格）**. Do **NOT** justify it as "GitHub 渲染规则" or "公式渲染需要空格" — the wiki MDX is rendered by KaTeX, which does not require this space; the space is purely for Chinese prose readability.
- Conversely, do not demand contributors add this space everywhere. Mention it only when it's a systematic pattern in the diff or it noticeably hurts readability.

## Your Comment Formatting (GitHub-renderer rule that applies ONLY to text YOU write in PR comments)

This rule governs how you format math in **your own** GitHub review comments so they render. It is **NOT** a rule about contributor MDX.

- GitHub Markdown only renders inline LaTeX when each `$` has a space on the outside. In YOUR comments, always write inline math with surrounding spaces, regardless of punctuation or brackets:
  - Correct: ` $E=mc^2$ `, `( $E=mc^2$ )`, ` $E=mc^2$ .`, ` $E=mc^2$ ，`
  - Wrong: `$E=mc^2$`, `($E=mc^2$)`, ` $E=mc^2$.`, ` $E=mc^2$，`
- Display math `$$ ... $$` blocks need surrounding blank lines.

### Do not conflate the two spacing rules

There are two different reasons a space might appear around `$...$`, and they apply in different places:

| Reason | Where it applies | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Markdown renderer requires it | YOUR review comments only | ` $E=mc^2$ ` inside a PR comment |
| Chinese typography (中英文/中文与公式之间加空格) | Contributor MDX prose, and also your comments when you write Chinese around math | `$5\Omega$ 电阻` inside an exam MDX |

Never cite "GitHub rendering" as a reason to modify contributor MDX. Contributor MDX is not rendered by GitHub.
